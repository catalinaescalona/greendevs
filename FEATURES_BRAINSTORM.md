# Brandon

Potential tools for Pollaris:

Frontend:  

  HTML - Provide structure  
  
  CSS - Styling and Design  
  
  React (JS Library) - User interface, excellent for single-page applications

Backend:  

  Flask - I don't know much about Flask, but it looks like an excellent Python framework for building a polling site.  
  
  Express JS - This is an alternative to using Flask. Built on Node js, looks great for building web apps.

Database Management:  

  Two options below, depending on if we were to go with Flask or Express JS.
  
  Flask-SQLAlchemy - Flask extension that adds support for SQLAlchemy. Will allow us to manage SQL databases using Python.  
  
  Express JS/Mongo DB - If we go with Express JS, it allows us to work with MongoDB.

  I prefer Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy over ExpressJS/MongoDB.

Website Layout:  

  Homepage: Logo in top left-hand corner, navigation links such as create poll, create user, login etc.  
  
  Create Poll Page: This could also be the homepage for simplicity. Allows user to create a poll.  
  
  About/FAQ Page: Describe the purpose of the site, answer simple questions.  
  
  *Optional - Browse Recent Polls Page: Depending on how long all this takes, if we have time, maybe have a page that shows recent or popular polls.
