Project Bugs and Issues:
* (input remaining bugs and issues here)
* Test cases - test driven development was diffuclt after we lost a team member
* Source documentation, and auto-doc files - could have been more comprehensive
* Users can vote as many times as they want, ideally we would restrict this to only one vote per user
* After creating a poll, if you refresh the display page the poll id and timestamp get updated. Not sure if this adds additional identical polls with a different id to the database.
