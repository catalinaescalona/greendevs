# Challenges We Encountered:
* Teammate left near end of semester
* Figuring out how frontend and backend fit together
* Unsure of best practices to implement solutions in new/unfamiliar languages. Each dev did something different, but we are not sure what is best (basically: we need senior devs for code review!)
* Merging everyone's local changes in GitHub (terrifying)
