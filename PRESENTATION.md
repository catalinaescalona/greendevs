#### HTML for Webpage Structure
* This allowed us to build the foundational structure of our site and enabled quick and simple development.

---

# Software Tools - Frontend (2/2):

#### CSS for Webpage Styling

* This was an effective tool for tracking our project sprints. The card system was very useful for tracking meetings, project tasks, and overall project development.
  
#### Zoom for Weekly Meetings
* This was a great communication tool that enabled video conferencing and increased team cohesion while working in a remote environment.

#### iMessage for Team Communication

# Challenges We Encountered (1/2):

* One of our teammates left mid semester, which impacted project continuity and required us to each individually take on his portions of the project.

* Figuring out how frontend and backend fit together presented a significant challenge. We overcame this with frequent testing, debugging, and trial and error.

---

# Challenges We Encountered (2/2):

* We were unsure of the best practices to implement solutions in new and unfamiliar languages. Each team member had different approaches to development, which worked out well, but having a senior developer to guide on best practices would have been extremely helpful. 
* The merging of everyone's local code changes in GitHub while keeping the site working was one of the most challenging aspects of the project.
