# Software Tools - Project Management:
Trello for Sprint Board
* This was an effective tool for tracking our project sprints. The card system was very useful for tracking meetings, project tasks, and overall project development.
  
Zoom for Weekly Meetings
* This was a great communication tool that enabled video conferencing and increased team cohesion while working in a remote environment.

iMessage for Team Communication
* This was a good tool for quick communication and updates, but made keeping a centralized record of tasks and decisions challenging. 

GitHub for Project Repository and Version Control
* This was a very valuable tool that enabled collaborative development for our team. Merging branches presented some challenges that we worked through.

Markdown for Project Documentation
* This tool was useful in simplifying and maintaining comprehensive project documentation.

# Software Tools - Frontend:
Canva for Webpage Mockups
* This was highly valuable free tool that enabled the creation of visual page mockups and design concepts.

HTML for Webpage Structure
* This allowed us to build the foundational structure of our site and enabled quick and simple development.

CSS for Webpage Styling
* This enabled site style elements to be implemented and provided an enhanced user interface.

JavaScript / jQuery for Webpage Dynamic Elements
* These tools were essential in adding dynamic elements and more advanced functionality to our project.

# Challenges We Encountered:
* Teammate left near end of semester
* Figuring out how frontend and backend fit together
* Unsure of best practices to implement solutions in new/unfamiliar languages. Each dev did something different, but we are not sure what is best (basically: we need senior devs for code review!)
* Merging everyone's local changes in GitHub (terrifying)
